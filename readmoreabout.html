          <p>
            From a young age, I've been fascinated by the power of computers and how they can shape the world around us. Over time, this fascination grew into a genuine interest in coding. I've spent countless hours self-learning and exploring various programming languages, tools, and frameworks to build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span>

            <p>
           My current focus lies in web development, where I've delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites. Additionally, I've explored the basics of Python and Java to understand the principles of object-oriented programming.and I also use figma to design my websites.But my learing backgrounds equipped me with the skills to learn any programming language or framework quickly and efficiently.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:5;"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
            My lack of formal experience hasn't deterred me. Instead, it has motivated me to take on various personal projects, where I've built small applications and websites to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. These projects have allowed me to sharpen my problem-solving abilities and develop a better understanding of coding best practices.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:6;"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to collaborate with others, work on exciting projects, and gain hands-on experience in a professional setting. I'm a quick learner, an excellent communicator, and I thrive in team environments. My lack of experience may be a limitation, but my determination and passion are boundless.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:6;"></span>
